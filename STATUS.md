## Next Steps Recommendation

1. **Set up Authentication**:
   - Integrate with Supabase authentication
   - Create user table and profile management

2. **Implement Core Database Structure**:
   - Design and create database schema
   - Set up relationships between entities

3. **Connect Frontend to Backend**:
   - Update React components to fetch from real APIs
   - Implement loading states and error handling

4. **Add Real Content Creation**:
   - Enable project creation and collaboration
   - Set up resource uploading functionality
   - Implement Q&A posting with comments

5. **Build Advanced Features**:
   - Search functionality
   - Analytics
   - Email notifications

## Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Backend**: Supabase (authentication, database, file storage)
- **API Layer**: Supabase functions or separate Express/Node.js API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, React Context for UI state
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage

## Conclusion
The application currently has a well-structured frontend with mock data visualization. To become a full-stack application, it needs proper backend integration, real data storage, authentication, and advanced features. The estimated completion for the full-stack implementation is approximately 65% of the total work.
